# El Torre de Salida Guest Guide
Hello, I’m very excited to have you visit me. This is a quick guide to help you know what to pack for your stay and what to expect while you’re here.

My guest home is currently in a state of evolution, so while the intent is for you to arrive and only need personal items, I have not yet achieved this goal.

## El Torre
### Accommodations
The house is a 3-bedroom, two-car garage downtown Salida townhouse.  All three bedrooms are currently outfitted for guests in a modest fashion.
 - Master bedroom
	 - Kingsize bed, with pillows, sheets, and comforter
	 - Bedside tables with lights and a storage headboard
	 - Two sink bathroom with a shower
	 - Small walk-in closet available
	 - Modest window coverings
 - Queen bedroom
	 - Queen bed with pillows, sheets, and comforter.
	 - Bedside tables with lights
	 - The closet currently contains my wardrobe
 - Full bedroom
	 - Full-size bed with sheets, comforter, and modest pillows.
	 - Storage headboard and reading lights.
	 - Desk with a television and a USB hub
	 - Modest window coverings
 - Starlink for broadband internet
 - Washer and dryer.
 - Bathrooms have the basics, soap, shampoo, etc
 - Inflatable spa (I'm mostly joking.  Mostly)
 - Dogs are welcome.  I have a small backyard wth poop scoop, and a baby gate.
 - A cat lives here.
### Where to find stuff
* Paper products
* - Each bathroom should have an extra roll under the sink.
  - Extra is in the downstairs pantry on the floor.
* Extra towels are in the upstairs hallway laundry closet.
### What to bring
 - Eye mask
	 - If light at night bothers you, you'll want an eyemask.  The proper bedrooms have blackout shades, but some light rays still make it through.
 - Pillow
	 - All the beds have nice pillows, but if you have a favorite pillow, bring that too.  The pillows will get nicer
 - Bath towel
	 I have these as well, but they are currently from Walmart.  They are good enough for most people.
 - Personal soaps
	 - Again, what I currently have is from Walmart.
 - Phone charger
	 - Eventually, I'll have these everywhere.  Currently not so much.
## Salida Activities

### Nordic skiing
