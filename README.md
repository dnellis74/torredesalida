# El Torre de Salida Guest Guide
Hello, I’m very excited to have you visit me. This is a quick guide to help you to know what to pack for your stay, and what to expect while you’re here.

My guest home is currently in state of evolution, so while the intent is for you to arrive and only need personal items, I have not yet achieved this goal.

## El Torre
### Accomodations

### What to bring
 - Eye mask
	 - If light at night bothers you, and until my blackout shades arrive, you'll want an eyemask.
 - Pillow
	 - All the beds have nice pillows, but if you have a favorite pillow, bring that too.  The pillows will get nicer
 - Bath towel
	 - I have these two, but they are from Walmart currently.  They are probably good enough for most people.
 -  Personal soaps
	 - Again, what I currently have is from Walmart.
 - Phone charger
	 - Eventually I'll have these everywhere.  Currently not so much.
## Salida Activities
### Hot springs
There are about half a dozen hot springs nearby, most within 30 minutes.  The are mineral water hot springs, and your waterproof phone and watch will get destroyed.
##### Bring

 - Pool shoes
 - Bag to carry things, unless you want to unnecessarily rent a $5 locker
### Nordic skiing
