# El Torre de Salida Guest Guide
Hello, I’m very excited to have you visit me. This is a quick guide to help you to know what to pack for your stay, and what to expect while you’re here.

My guest home is currently in state of evolution, so while the intent is for you to arrive and only need personal items, I have not yet achieved this goal.

## El Torre
### Accomodations
The house is a 3 bedroom, two car garage downtown Salida townhouse.  All three bedroom are currently outfitted for guests in a modest fashion.
 - Master bedroom
	 - Kingsize bed, with pillows, sheets, and comforter
	 - Bedside tables with lights, and storage headboard
	 - Two sink bathroom with shower
	 - Small walk in closet available
	 - Modest window coverings
 - Queen bedroom
	 - Queen bed with pillows, sheets, and comforter.
	 - Bedside tables with lights
	 - Closet that currently contains my wardrobe

	 - Full size bed with sheets, comforter, and modest pillows.
	 - Storage headboard, and reading lights.
	 - Desk with television and USB hub
	 - Modest window coverings

 - Bathrooms have the basics, soap shampoo, etc
 - Inflatable spa (I'm mostly joking.  Mostly)

### What to bring
 - Eye mask
	 - If light at night bothers you, and until my blackout shades arrive, you'll want an eyemask.
 - Pillow
	 - All the beds have nice pillows, but if you have a favorite pillow, bring that too.  The pillows will get nicer
 - Bath towel
	 - I have these two, but they are from Walmart currently.  They are probably good enough for most people.
 -  Personal soaps
	 - Again, what I currently have is from Walmart.
 - Phone charger
	 - Eventually I'll have these everywhere.  Currently not so much.
## Salida Activities

##### Bring

 - Bag to carry things, unless you want to unnecessarily rent a $5 locker
### Nordic skiing
There is lots of great nordic skiing nearby.  Rentals are available from Salida Mountain Sports
